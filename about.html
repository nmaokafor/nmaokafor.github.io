    <h2 class="head1">ABOUT SUPPLY AID</h2>
    <h3 class="head2">The Vision</h3>
    <p class="para1">To be a catalyst in the movement to empower women and send children to schools, giving them a better tomorrow.</p>
  <br> 

    <h3 class="head2">The Mission</h3>
    <p class="para1"> To bridge the gap between willing donors/volunteers around the world and non-profits within Africa believing that significant impact starts with a little change everyday and cummulative effort over time.</p>
   <br>

    <h3 class="head2">The Problems</h3>
      <p class="para1">
        Women make enormous contributions to the economy, in businesses, on farms, as entrepreneurs or employees, or by doing unpaid care work at home. Yet they also remain disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination and exploitation. Gender discrimination means women often end up in insecure, low-wage jobs, and constitute a small minority of those in senior positions. It curtails access to economic assets such as land and loans. It limits participation in shaping economic and social policies. And, because women perform the bulk of household work, they often have little time left to pursue economic opportunities.
        <br>
        <p class="para1">Women and girls are subject to various forms of harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). Despite progress, child marriage and female genital mutilation remain unacceptably high. This results immediate to long-term multiple physical, sexual and mental consequences for women and girls, including death. It negatively affects women’s general well-being and prevents women from fully participating in society.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="para1">Women remain underrepresented in leadership and management level positions in the public and private sectors. Parity is still far from reality.Disparities between the number of children in schools within rural and urban areas remain high. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Millions of children in rural communities are trapped in child labour and even within urban communities, underpriviledged children are out of school resorting to begging or street hawking.</p>
        <br>
    <h3 class="head2">The Solutions</h3>
      <p class="para1">Promote and Volunteer to programmes that help improve women’s ability to secure decent jobs, accumulate assets. Take actions so that women and men can more readily paid equal wages for similar work done.
      Help non-profits reach out to women most in need, by donating so that they can organize outreaches where they empower, educate and engage with grass-roots and civil society organizations, particularly marginalized groups such as rural women, domestic workers, some migrants and low-skilled women.
    <br>
      Spread the word to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. Speak against all forms of violence against women. Donate and volunteer to medical outreaches where FGM victims are treated.
    <br>
    <br>
      Support more women to participate in politics to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.
    <br>
       Help non-profits provide improved access to primary education, donate to school food programmes as this initiative encourages school attendance and have long-lasting social, economic and environmental benefits for the community as a whole. Participate in outreaches where parents of these children are spoken to, significant progress cannot be made if the parents do not let their children have access to the opportunities that they need to progress.</p>
