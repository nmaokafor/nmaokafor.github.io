      <p><b>Africa School Assistance Project (ASAP)</b> is a non-profit organisation that builds schools in rural Tanzanian villages and each summer leads groups of volunteers to work on the schools. ASAP is currently seeking volunteers for school building trips in June 2018. They will be working in a rural area outside of Arusha, Tanzania to build, expand and enhance school facilities for school children of the area. They welcome adults and children alike—anyone with an adventurous spirit and a big heart!  Volunteers will spend their days working on building the schools, and will spend their evenings under some of the most stunning stars visible from anywhere on earth!

      <p><b>Build Africa</b> works to identify vulnerable government and community schools that are already in existence. Using that unique model, they then address the needs of children at home, at school and in the community - working together with parents and teachers to overcome the barriers of poverty and inequality that can stand in their children's way. They help parents to earn a secure living, communities to value education and tackle discrimination against girls and marginalised children so that no child is left behind.
      They construct and renovate classrooms, libraries and important facilities, as well as improve access to hygienic toilets and clean drinking water - creating a safe and engaging environment for children.
      They provide important educational materials and textbooks, train teachers and give them the professional support they need to inspire their students. <a href="https://www.build-africa.org/"> learn more</a>
